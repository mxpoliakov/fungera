### Running Fungera

Python 3.7 is required to run Fungera. Once it is installed, running Fungera is simple.

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python fungera.py --name "Simulation 1"
```

### Install issues

In case of issues with "curses" library under windows 10, please use [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32417379/what-is-needed-for-curses-in-python-3-4-on-windows7) approach. And than, install all dependencies from "requirements.txt" file manually (except "curses").
